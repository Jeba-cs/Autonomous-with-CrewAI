# 🧠 Autonomous PDF Assistant with CrewAI + DeepSeek

This project implements an intelligent autonomous agent system using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) and the [DeepSeek API](https://deepseek.com) to analyze uploaded PDF documents. It can answer user queries or summarize documents based on context, using agent reasoning and a vector database (FAISS) for memory.
